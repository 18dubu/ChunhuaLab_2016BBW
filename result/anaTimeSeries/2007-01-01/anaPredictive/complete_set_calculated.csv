D/C if serious infection or sepsis develops. Active/latent reactivation TB patients have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease; test for latent TB before and during therapy and initiate treatment for latent TB prior to adalimumab use. Invasive fungal infections reported; consider empiric antifungal therapy in patients at risk who develop severe systemic illness. Monitor patients closely for development of infection during and after treatment, including development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to therapy. Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, reported in children and adolescents. Postmarketing cases of aggressive and fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) reported in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males; all of these patients were treated concomitantly with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine.	181	75	10	13	1359.4	305.538461538462	0.0117151800954824	0.833654129947339	0.0472985708268732	0.814668617850631
