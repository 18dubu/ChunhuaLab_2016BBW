abilify	druglabelid=103	1	Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death; most deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (CV) (eg, heart failure [HF], sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Not approved for treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. Antidepressants increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Monitor and observe closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior in patients who are started on antidepressant therapy. Not approved for use in pediatric patients with depression.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/abilify?druglabelid=103

ablavar	druglabelid=1163	1	Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs; avoid use unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with noncontrasted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis. Risk for NSF appears highest among patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR <30mL/min), or acute kidney injury. Screen for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Estimate GFR through laboratory testing in patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, >60 yrs of age, HTN, diabetes). For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of drug from the body prior to any readministration.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/ablavar?druglabelid=1163

kadcyla	druglabelid=3087	1	Do not substitute for or with trastuzumab. Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, reported; monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin prior to initiation of therapy and prior to each dose. Reduce dose or d/c as appropriate in cases of increased serum transaminases/total bilirubin. May lead to reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Evaluate left ventricular function (LVF) prior to and during treatment; withhold treatment for clinically significant decrease in LVF. Exposure during pregnancy may result in embryo-fetal death or birth defects; advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/kadcyla?druglabelid=3087
kadian	druglabelid=1680	1	Contains morphine, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse liability similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit; assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing.

Causes permanent bilateral concentric visual field constriction in a high percentage of adult patients; in some cases may damage central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure; use lowest dose and shortest exposure. D/C in patients who fail to show clinical benefit within 2-4 weeks (pediatric patients) or 3 months (adults) of initiation, or sooner if treatment failure is obvious. Vision loss may not be recognized until it is severe. Unless a patient is formally exempted from periodic ophthalmologic assessment, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting therapy), at least every 3 months during therapy and about 3-6 months after therapy is discontinued. Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if visual loss is documented. Vision loss may worsen despite discontinuation of therapy. Unless benefit clearly outweighs the risk, avoid use with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects (eg, retinopathy, glaucoma) and in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss.

xarelto	druglabelid=278	1	Premature discontinuation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If therapy is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Epidural or spinal hematomas have occurred in patients treated with rivaroxaban who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture; long-term or permanent paralysis may result. Increased risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in patients using indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants), history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery, and when optimal timing between the administration of therapy and neuraxial procedure is not known. Monitor frequently for signs/symptoms of neurological impairment; urgent treatment is necessary if neurological compromise occurs. Consider benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/xarelto?druglabelid=278
xeljanz	druglabelid=2716	1	Increased risk for developing serious infections (eg, active tuberculosis [TB], invasive fungal infections, bacterial/viral infections due to opportunistic pathogens) that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate [MTX], corticosteroids). If a serious infection develops, interrupt treatment until infection is controlled. Test for latent TB prior to and during therapy; initiate latent TB treatment prior to therapy. Consider risks and benefits prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Monitor for development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment. Lymphoma and other malignancies reported. Increased rate of Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder observed in renal transplant patients with concomitant immunosuppressive medications.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/xeljanz?druglabelid=2716
xeloda	druglabelid=2039	1	Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, reported with concomitant coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, phenprocoumon). Monitor PT and INR frequently in order to adjust anticoagulant dose accordingly. Postmarketing reports showed clinically significant increases in PT and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at start of therapy. Age >60 yrs and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose to an increased risk of coagulopathy.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/xeloda?druglabelid=2039

eliquis	druglabelid=3039	1	Discontinuing therapy increases the risk of thrombotic events. Increased rate of stroke reported following discontinuation of therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (A-fib). If therapy must be discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. When neuraxial anesthesia (epidural/spinal anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients anticoagulated or scheduled to be anticoagulated with apixaban for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma, which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Increased risk of epidural/spinal hematomas by the use of indwelling epidural catheters for administration of analgesia or by concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet aggregation inhibitors, or other anticoagulants). The risk also appears to be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. Monitor for signs/symptoms of neurologic impairment; urgent treatment is necessary if neurologic compromise is noted. Consider potential benefit vs risk before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/eliquis?druglabelid=3039

gentamicin-injection-10-mg-ml	druglabelid=3300	1	Potential for nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity; adjust dose or d/c on evidence of ototoxicity/nephrotoxicity. Risk of nephrotoxicity is greater with impaired renal function and in those who receive high dose or prolonged therapy. Neurotoxicity (eg, vestibular and auditory ototoxicity) can occur with preexisting renal damage or with normal renal function treated at higher doses and/or longer treatment periods than recommended. Closely monitor renal and 8th cranial nerve function, especially in patients with known or suspected reduced renal function at onset of therapy and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Examine urine for decreased specific gravity, increased protein excretion, and presence of cells/casts. Monitor BUN, SrCr or CrCl periodically. Obtain serial audiograms in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients, when feasible. Periodically monitor peak and trough serum concentrations to assure adequate levels and to avoid toxicity. Dose should be adjusted when monitoring peak and trough concentrations; avoid prolonged peak levels >12mcg/mL and trough levels >2mcg/mL. Hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is or becomes compromised. Consider exchange transfusions in the newborn infant. Avoid concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs (eg, cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, viomycin). Advanced age and dehydration may increase risk of toxicity. Avoid with potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide).

isotonic-gentamicin-sulfate	druglabelid=1736	1	Potential for nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity; adjust dose or d/c on evidence of ototoxicity/nephrotoxicity. Risk of nephrotoxicity is greater with impaired renal function and in those who receive high dose or prolonged therapy. Neurotoxicity (eg, vestibular and auditory ototoxicity) can occur with preexisting renal damage or with normal renal function treated at higher doses and/or longer treatment periods than recommended. Closely monitor renal and 8th cranial nerve function, especially in patients with known or suspected reduced renal function at onset of therapy and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Examine urine for decreased specific gravity, increased protein excretion, and presence of cells/casts. Monitor BUN, SrCr or CrCl periodically. Obtain serial audiograms in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients, when feasible. Periodically monitor peak and trough serum concentrations to assure adequate levels and to avoid toxicity. Dose should be adjusted when monitoring peak and trough concentrations; avoid prolonged peak levels >12mcg/mL and trough levels >2mcg/mL. Hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is or becomes compromised. Consider exchange transfusions in the newborn infant. Avoid concurrent and/or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs (eg, cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, viomycin). Advanced age and dehydration may increase risk of toxicity. Avoid with potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide).

nitropress	druglabelid=3404	1	Not suitable for direct inj; dilute in sterile D5 inj before infusion. May cause precipitous decreases in BP; may lead to irreversible ischemic injuries or death if not monitored properly. Use only when available equipment and personnel allow BP to be continuously monitored. Except when used briefly or at low (<2mcg/kg/min) infusion rates, nitroprusside gives rise to important quantities of cyanide ion, which can reach toxic, potentially lethal levels. The usual dose rate is 0.5-10mcg/kg/min, but infusion at the max dose rate should never last >10 min; d/c immediately if BP has not been controlled by max rate after 10 min. Although acid-base balance and venous oxygen concentration should be monitored and may indicate cyanide toxicity, these tests provide imperfect guidance.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/nitropress?druglabelid=3404

Closely monitor renal and eighth-nerve function in patients with known or suspected renal impairment and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Periodically monitor peak and trough serum concentrations to assure adequate levels and to avoid toxicity. Avoid prolonged serum concentrations >12mcg/mL. Rising trough levels (>2mcg/mL) may indicate tissue accumulation. Tissue accumulation, excessive peak concentrations, advanced age, and cumulative dose may contribute to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Test urine for decreased specific gravity and increased excretion of protein, cells, and casts. Periodically monitor BUN, SrCr, and CrCl. Obtain serial audiograms in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients, when feasible. D/C or adjust dose with renal, vestibular, or auditory dysfunction. Caution in premature and neonatal infants, with advanced age, and dehydration. Avoid with other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic antibiotics, particularly other aminoglycosides (eg, amikacin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, paromomycin), cephaloridine, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, cisplatin, and vancomycin. Avoid with potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide). May cause fetal harm.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/tobramycin?druglabelid=916

mifeprex	druglabelid=2733	1	Serious and sometimes fatal infections and bleeding occur very rarely following spontaneous, surgical, and medical abortions. Ensure that patient knows whom to call and what to do, including going to emergency room if provided contacts are not reachable, if experiencing sustained fever, severe abdominal pain, prolonged heavy bleeding, or syncope, or if experiencing abdominal pain/discomfort or general malaise >24 hrs after taking misoprostol. Serious bacterial infections and sepsis can present without fever, bacteremia or significant findings on pelvic examination following an abortion; high index of suspicion is needed to rule out serious infection and sepsis. Prolonged heavy bleeding may be a sign of incomplete abortion or other complications; prompt medical/surgical intervention may be needed. Advise patients to take the Medication Guide with them when visiting an emergency room or another health care provider who did not prescribe the drug, so that provider will be aware that patient is undergoing medical abortion.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/mifeprex?druglabelid=2733

pradaxa	druglabelid=100	1	Premature discontinuation of therapy increases the risk of thrombotic events. If therapy is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with dabigatran who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture; may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling for spinal procedures. Increased risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas with the use of indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis (eg, NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants), history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures, history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery, or unknown optimal timing between the administration of therapy and neuraxial procedures. Monitor frequently for signs/symptoms of neurological impairment; if neurologic compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/pradaxa?druglabelid=100

Obtain baseline WBC count and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) prior to therapy, regularly during treatment, and for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation. Seizures may occur and risk is dose related; caution with history of seizures or other predisposing factors. Increased risk of fatal myocarditis, especially during 1st month of therapy; d/c if suspected. Orthostatic hypotension, with or without syncope, can occur and is more likely during initial titration. Rare reports of profound collapse with respiratory and/or cardiac arrest reported; caution when initiating therapy in patients taking benzodiazepines or any other psychotropic drugs. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk for death; most deaths appeared to be cardiovascular (CV) (eg, heart failure [HF], sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature.

amikacin-sulfate	druglabelid=676	1	Potential for nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity; adjust dose or d/c on evidence of ototoxicity/nephrotoxicity. Risk of nephrotoxicity is greater with impaired renal function and in those who receive high dose or prolonged therapy. Neurotoxicity (eg, vestibular and permanent bilateral auditory ototoxicity) can occur with preexisting renal damage and normal renal function treated at higher doses and/or longer treatment periods than recommended. Hearing loss may increase with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. After the drug has been discontinued, total or partial irreversible bilateral deafness may occur. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory paralysis reported following parenteral inj, topical instillation (as in orthopedic and abdominal irrigation or in local treatment of empyema), and oral use of therapy. Increased risk of neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis with anesthetics, neuromuscular blockers or massive transfusions of citrate-anticoagulated blood. Closely monitor renal and 8th cranial nerve function. Examine urine for decreased specific gravity, increased protein excretion, and presence of cells/casts. Obtain serial audiograms in patients old enough to be tested. Avoid concurrent and/or sequential neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs and potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide). Advanced age and dehydration may increase risk of toxicity.	http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/amikacin-sulfate?druglabelid=676
